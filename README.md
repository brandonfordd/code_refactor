# code_refactor

This repository was made to refract a website for a homework assignment. The assignment asked us to make changes to the index and css file located in our week one homework assignments. While refracting we were also tasked with adding comments to the css describing the functionality of the code and re arranging exiting code for simplicity. While doing so I also changed certain divs in the index for more syntax.
